# Alba

Alba is a privacy-first Chrome extension that gives AI users a live view of the energy, carbon, and water cost of every prompt. It wraps popular AI chat surfaces (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity) with inline impact estimates, a prompt optimizer, and a daily footprint recap.

## Citation

If you use ALBA in your research or work, please cite it using the following DOI:

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.18675123.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18675123)

You can cite all versions by using the DOI [10.5281/zenodo.18675123](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18675123). This DOI represents all versions and will always resolve to the latest one.
## Highlights
- **Real-time footprint labels** – as you type, Alba estimates watt-hours, grams CO₂, and water milliliters based on model size, region, and modality.
- **Inline prompt optimizer** – local heuristics trim filler immediately; optional AI optimization (via Alba's server-side proxy to GitHub Models) proposes a compressed rewrite showing % savings before you accept.
- **Floating dashboard + popup** – a widget and browser popup show "Today" vs "This chat," compare against yesterday, export CSV, and reset totals.
- **Spotify-style "Wrapped"** – on-demand recap cards celebrate the energy, carbon, and water you avoided.
- **Configurable methodology** – edit `energyConfig.js` to adjust model profiles, modalities, baselines, or default settings.
- **No API keys in the extension** – AI features call a lightweight server-side proxy (a Cloudflare Worker) that holds the GitHub Models token as a server secret; no token or key ships to users. Impact estimates and the local optimizer still run entirely on-device.

## Repository Layout
| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `content.js` | Main content script that injects impact labels, optimizer UI, widget, and wrapped summary. |
| `aiClient.js` | Calls the Alba proxy for optimization and wrapped features (no token; falls back to local-only when the proxy is unset or unreachable). |
| `proxy/` | Cloudflare Worker proxy that holds the GitHub Models token as a server secret and forwards the `optimize`/`wrapped` requests. |
| `energyConfig.js` | Central coefficients, model profiles, regional factors, and default settings. |
| `popup.html`, `popup.js`, `styles.css` | Browser popup for toggles, summaries, CSV export, and theming. |
| `manifest.json` | Chrome extension manifest (MV3) targeting major AI chat domains; lists the proxy URL in `host_permissions`. |
| `scripts/build.cjs` | Build script that copies the extension files and creates the distribution ZIP (no secrets injected). |
| `.github/workflows/` | GitHub Actions workflow for automated builds. |

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Download from GitHub Actions (Recommended)
1. Go to the [Actions tab](https://github.com/lindsaygross/Alba/actions)
2. Click on the latest successful workflow run
3. Download the `alba-extension` artifact
4. Unzip and load in Chrome (see below)

### Option 2: Build Locally
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/lindsaygross/Alba.git
cd Alba

# Build the extension (no secrets needed — AI calls go through the proxy)
npm run build
```

AI features (the AI optimizer and Eco Wrapped) require the `PROXY_URL` in `aiClient.js` to point at a deployed Alba proxy. See `proxy/README.md` to deploy the Cloudflare Worker and set its `GITHUB_MODELS_TOKEN` secret. With no reachable proxy, the extension silently falls back to local-only behavior.

### Load the Extension
1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer mode**
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `dist/` folder

## Using Alba
- Open ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Perplexity
- Type as usual – the inline bar updates with energy/carbon/water estimates
- When the optimizer is enabled, suggestions appear after a short pause
- Click the floating Alba widget to toggle views, open Wrapped recap, or reset/export
- Use the popup (toolbar icon) for settings: enable/disable, model profile, region, theme

## Configuration

### Model Profiles & Regions
Edit `energyConfig.js` to adjust:
- Watt-hours per 1k tokens by model size (small, balanced, large)
- Regional grid CO₂ factors (global, US, EU, APAC)
- Water intensity factors

### Optimizer Behavior
Toggle `remoteOptimizer` in the popup settings to enable/disable AI-powered optimization.

### AI Proxy
The extension never holds an API key. When the AI optimizer or Eco Wrapped is used, `aiClient.js` POSTs a constrained request (`optimize` or `wrapped`) to the proxy URL in its `PROXY_URL` constant. The proxy — a Cloudflare Worker in `proxy/` — holds the GitHub Models token as a server secret, owns the system prompts, and forwards the request to GitHub Models. To run your own, deploy the worker per `proxy/README.md` and point `PROXY_URL` at it.

### Adding New Sites
Extend the `SITE_CONFIGS` array in `content.js` with new host patterns and selectors.

## Development

### GitHub Actions Build
The workflow automatically builds the extension on push to `main`:
1. Checks out code
2. Installs dependencies
3. Creates `dist/` folder and ZIP artifact

No build-time secrets are involved — the token lives only in the proxy, never in the build.

### Deploying the AI Proxy
AI features are powered by the Cloudflare Worker in `proxy/`. To set it up:
1. Create a GitHub PAT with Models access
2. Deploy the worker and set its secret: `wrangler secret put GITHUB_MODELS_TOKEN`
3. Point `PROXY_URL` in `aiClient.js` (and `host_permissions` in `manifest.json`) at the deployed worker URL

See `proxy/README.md` for full deployment steps.

## Troubleshooting
- **No UI appears**: Confirm the tab matches `manifest.json` domains and extension is enabled in popup.
- **Optimizer not working**: Confirm `PROXY_URL` in `aiClient.js` points at a reachable proxy and that the worker's `GITHUB_MODELS_TOKEN` secret is set.
- **"Proxy URL not configured"**: `PROXY_URL` is still the placeholder – AI features use the local fallback until you point it at a deployed proxy.
